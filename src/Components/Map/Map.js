        COVID-19 vaccines may be available at non-VA sites and are generally without cost to the recipient. 
        However, please note, because 2nd dose vaccines are being sent to the same place as where each person 
        gets their 1st dose, you must get your 2nd dose from the same source as your 1st (except under very rare circumstances). 
        This will ensure 2nd dose vaccines are available for Veterans who were previously vaccinated at the VA San 
        Diego Healthcare System. As with most services and care we provide, we are unable to administer vaccinations 
        to unenrolled spouses and other family members.`,
